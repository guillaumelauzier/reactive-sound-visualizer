# reactive-sound-visualizer

This code uses the line() function to draw lines in 3D space based on the frequency data from an MP3 file. The lines are colored using a selection of colors stored in an array. The code also includes a setup function to load and play an MP3 file, and a draw function to update the visualization over time.
